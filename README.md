Small tool for automated screenshot uploading and analyzing.

Still pretty embrionary, but _sorta_ functional.

The graphic interface is not yet implemented, but an interactive mockup can be [found here](http://bit.ly/clip_m).

Since it uses the ImageGrab module from [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow), it currently only works in **Windows**, but **OS X** compatibility is said to be coming soon!
